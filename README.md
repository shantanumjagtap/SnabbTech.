Project Description
This Terraform project aims to automate the provisioning and management of a cloud infrastructure environment. By using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, it simplifies the deployment and maintenance of resources in popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Whether you're a DevOps engineer, system administrator, or developer, this project helps you create and manage infrastructure with efficiency and consistency.

Key Features
Infrastructure as Code: Define your infrastructure using simple, human-readable configuration files, allowing you to version and track changes over time.

Modularity: The project is organized into reusable modules, making it easy to construct complex infrastructure by combining smaller, well-defined components.

Customization: Tailor the configuration to your specific needs, adjusting resource sizes, configurations, and settings to match your requirements.

Scaling: Easily scale resources up or down in response to changing demands, without manual intervention.

Security: Follow best practices for security and compliance, ensuring that your infrastructure is resilient and protected.

Cost Management: Implement cost-control measures by tracking and managing your cloud resources efficiently.

Documentation: Detailed documentation and examples make it easy for users to understand and get started with the project.
